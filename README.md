# DemocracyJobBoardWebsite
Project I am working to where users vote up or down on jobs submitted by users. Downvoted jobs are put lower in relevancy and the highest voted is put higher in site relevancy.I want to learn database storing and manipulation and make a fun project idea to do so : ). 


Very unpolished/unfished verson. Will return to after finishing other projects. Posting to git as to easier access these files. Thank you for taking a look at my project : )
